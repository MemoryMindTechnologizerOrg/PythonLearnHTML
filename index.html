<h1 id="H1B">Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</h1>
<p id="p2"> Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is key to developing large, scalable Python applications.</p>
<p id="p3">Here's a quick overview:</p>

<p id="p4">Classes and Objects: Everything in Python is an object. A class is a blueprint for creating objects (instances).</p>

<pre>
    <code id="code1">
class Car:
    def __init__(self, make, model, year):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.year = year
        
    def display_info(self):
        print(f"{self.year} {self.make} {self.model}")
        
car1 = Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 2021)
car1.display_info()  # Outputs: 2021 Toyota Corolla
    </code>
</pre>
<p id="p5">Inheritance: Allows one class to inherit the attributes and methods of another class.</p>

    <p id="p6">Example: A SportsCar class inherits from Car.</p>
    <p id="p7">Polymorphism: Different classes can have methods with the same name but different behaviors.</p>

<h1 id="H1Book">The Book is The Reading</h1>
<h1 id="H1MindReading">FaceBook is Mind-Reading</h1>
<h1 id="H1C">"Your Not my Twin!" --MillionFaced</h1>
<pre>
    <code id="code1">
class Bird:
    def speak(self):
        print("Tweet")

class Dog:
    def speak(self):
        print("Bark")

# Demonstrating polymorphism
animals = [Bird(), Dog()]
for animal in animals:
    animal.speak()  # Outputs: Tweet, Bark
    </code>
</pre>
<p id="p8">Encapsulation: Hides the internal state and protects the object from unwanted changes.</p>
<p id="p9">Use the private and protected attributes for controlled access.</p>
<h1 id="H1D">Working with Python Libraries</h1>
<span><p id="p10">Python’s power comes largely from its vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks. For high-level applications, you must become familiar with the most essential ones:</p>

<p id="p11">NumPy: For efficient numerical computation, providing support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.</p>
<p id="p12">Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.</p>
<p id="p13">Matplotlib & Seaborn: For plotting and visualizing data.</p>
<p id="p14">Requests: For making HTTP requests and interacting with APIs.</p>
<p id="p15">Each of these libraries streamlines the process of handling complex tasks with a minimal amount of code.</p>

<img id="img3" src="/satoshisonthemoonwho.png", width="1289px", height="445px", align-image="center">
<h1 id="H1E">Concurrency and Parallelism</h1>
<p id="p16">To take your Python skills to the next level, understanding how to optimize programs for performance is crucial. Concurrency and parallelism are two techniques that can significantly improve the speed of certain programs, especially in data-heavy or time-sensitive applications.</p>
<p id="p17">Concurrency: Performing multiple tasks at once (but not necessarily simultaneously).</p>
<p id="p18">Use asyncio and the async/await keywords to create concurrent tasks.</p>
<p id="p19">Parallelism: Running multiple tasks simultaneously, typically on different processors or cores.</p>
<p id="p20">Use Python’s multiprocessing module for parallel tasks.</p>
<pre id="precode1">
    <code id="code1">
import asyncio

async def fetch_data():
    print("Fetching data...")
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    print("Data fetched!")

async def main():
    await asyncio.gather(fetch_data(), fetch_data())

# Running the asyncio event loop
asyncio.run(main())

<h1 id="H1G">To explore quantum computing:</h1>
<p id="p18">Start with Qiskit, a Python library that allows you to work with quantum circuits, gates, and simulators.</p>
<p id="p19">Example of creating a basic quantum circuit in Qiskit:</p>
<pre>
    <code id="code1">
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, Aer, execute

# Create a quantum circuit with one qubit
qc = QuantumCircuit(1)

# Apply a Hadamard gate to create superposition
qc.h(0)

# Measure the qubit
qc.measure_all()

# Simulate the circuit
simulator = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
result = execute(qc, simulator).result()

# Print the results
counts = result.get_counts(qc)
print(counts)

    </code>
